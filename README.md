## Description

The **Save Circle** Flexible Ladder Saving System (FLSM) - The Flexible Ladder Saving System (FLSM) is a digital, community-driven savings and micro-credit platform created specifically for financially struggling women in Sri Lanka. Many of these women, particularly those receiving Aswasuma benefits and other forms of government support, face severe challenges in managing household expenses, accessing credit, or saving for essential life needs.
FLSM offers a dignified, safe, and flexible solution that enables these women to save toward their personal and family goals, such as education, healthcare, or emergencies, while also offering peer-supported short-term assistance when unexpected financial gaps arise. Through digital wallets and mobile integration, the system ensures that even women with limited digital literacy or financial background can participate confidently and securely.

## Problem Statement

Women in low-income communities often shoulder the financial responsibilities of their families while facing structural barriers to economic empowerment. Most lack access to reliable savings mechanisms or safe credit options. With irregular or insufficient income, they are frequently unable to handle urgent costs like school fees or medical bills, leading them into harmful cycles of borrowing from exploitative sources.
Traditional banking and financial systems fail to meet their needs due to inflexible terms, high-interest rates, and accessibility issues. There is a critical need for a community-centric, trustworthy system that enables these women to save consistently, borrow fairly, and manage money with dignity and transparency.
The Flexible Ladder Saving System (FLSM) addresses this urgent gap by combining community pooling methods with mobile-first financial technology. It allows financially vulnerable women to collaborate, contribute, and support one another in achieving financial independence, while remaining protected from loan exploitation and risk.


## Objective

- Empower Goal-Oriented Saving
- Enable Peer-Supported Borrowing
- Promote Transparent and Predictable Repayment
- Minimize Lending Risks
- Support Multiple Simultaneous Goals
- Allow Early Access to Funds
- Safeguard Lenders’ Progress
- Integrate Accessible Payment Options


## System Concept
The system works like a "flexible ladder," where each woman’s savings goal is placed on a rung based on its deadline. Women whose needs are urgent (lower rungs) can borrow from those whose goals are further away (higher rungs). Loan amounts are pooled from multiple women to reduce risk, and repayments are automated through future contributions.
This approach ensures solidarity and shared success—women with long-term goals assist those with urgent needs, confident that they will be supported in return when their time comes.


## How It Works
1. Each woman registers on the platform and defines one or more savings goals (e.g., childbirth expenses, a child’s tuition, medicine).
2. She commits to contributing regularly—weekly or monthly—via her preferred payment method: mobile wallet, government reload, or bank/card.
3. Contributions are securely tracked, and the system places her goal on the virtual “ladder” based on its deadline.
4. If a goal is nearing its deadline and lacks funds, the system sources small loans from women whose own goals are due later.
5. As the borrower continues contributing, up to 80% of her future payments go toward automatic repayment to her community lenders.

This approach promotes mutual upliftment, financial discipline, and autonomy—all while removing the fear and shame often tied to borrowing.
